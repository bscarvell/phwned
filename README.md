### Grandstream Backdoor Removal Tool

Grandstream GXV3275 Android VoIP phones come with a vendor backdoor by default when unpacked out of the box. This tool attempts to automate the removal of this backdoor. For more information, go to [http://phwned.com](http://phwned.com).

**NOTE:** This has only been successfully tested with the **kernel version <= 1.0.1.9**. Later versions (I've tested up to **v1.0.1.12**) seem to put the file system into read-only. You will have to try roll back for this to work if you're running a later kernel.
